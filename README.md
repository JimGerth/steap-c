# **STEAP**: **S**imple **T**hr**EA**d **P**ool

This is a very simple thread pool implementation written in C in the context of
an operating systems university course.

It is not supposed to actually be used in any real problem, but is rather meant
to demonstrate the use of the `pthread` library and general C coding principles,
such as the use of header files and thread safety via code synchronization.

## Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimGerth/steap-c.git
cd steap-c
make
./thread_pool
```
